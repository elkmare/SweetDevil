    name: 'Her True Name is Altera (アルテラ,), better known in history as Attila the Hun (アッティラ・ザ・フン). She was the overlord who established a great empire in the 5th Century. She was a warrior and king of the Huns, a tribe descending from the Xiongnu (Hunni). Leading an army of cavalry, the conquests of this great hero covered a great part of the map, controlling a vast territory spanning from Western Asia to Russia, Eastern Europe and even Gaul. It can be said that she invited the eventual collapse of the Roman Empire. Throughout her life, Altera was always in the midst of battle. Due to the terrifying acts she commited in war, she was greatly feared in all European nations as the Scourge of God (神の懲罰) and the Whip of God (神の鞭). She is a pure King of Combat (戦闘王).'

    name: 'Archer\'s True Name is Gilgamesh, the great half-god, half-human king born from the union between the King of Uruk, Lugalbanda, and goddess Rimat-Ninsun. He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era. He was an ultimate, transcendent being so divine as to be two-thirds god and one-third human, and no others in the world could match him. He was a despot possessing high divinity who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. He was the King of Heroes (英雄王, Eiyū-Ō?) who possessed all things in the world, whose tale is recorded in mankind\'s oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu.'
